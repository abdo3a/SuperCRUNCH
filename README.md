---------------

## Overview

**SuperCRUNCH** is a python program used to create, filter and manipulate large phylogenetic data sets based on nucleotide data downloaded directly from NCBI. It can be used to search for specified sets of taxa and loci to create population or species-level molecular data sets, including phylogenetic supermatrices. It offers a variety of transparent and flexible options for orthology detection, sequence selection, alignment, and file manipulation. The **SuperCRUNCH** workflow allows rapid construction of phylogenetic supermatrices from downloaded sequence data, greatly simplifying the process of updating large phylogenies with newly available molecular data. Because **SuperCRUNCH** streamlines tasks like alignment, trimming, and concatenation, it can also be used to efficiently process sequence capture data sets. 

## Installation

**SuperCRUNCH** consists of several Python modules that can be used as command line scripts, and therefore does not require any installation. The scripts do not require being in the same directory, and can function independently. There are some external dependencies that should be installed prior to use of **SuperCRUNCH**, and a list of these dependencies and installation instructions can be found on the wiki page [here](to fill in).


## Tutorials and Example Analyses

Complete instructions for running **SuperCRUNCH** analyses are available on the wiki page [here](to fill in), including detailed usage for all modules, proposed workflows, and common issues.

Several example analyses are available two unrelated clades:
***Iguania*** - an infraorder of squamate reptiles
***Dipsacales*** - a order of flowering plants 
The complete set of material for these analyses, including all command instructions and all output files, is freely available [here](https://osf.io/bpt94/) on the **SuperCRUNCH** Open Science Framework project page.
