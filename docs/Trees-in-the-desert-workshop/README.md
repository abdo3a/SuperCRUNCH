## Trees in the Desert Workshop

### April 12-14th, Tucson, Arizona

The [Trees in the Desert workshop](http://db.herbarium.arizona.edu/phlora/TID/WorkshopPage.html) was held to discuss challenges related to ultra-large phylogenetic trees. A variety of topics were covered, including scalability of conventional tree building methods, coalescent and gene-tree approaches, missing data and terraces, and scalable inference of tree annotations. Presentations and hands-on tutorials were provided, and SuperCRUNCH was included as an example of improvements to phylogenetic workflows. 

This folder contains the presentation for SuperCRUNCH, along with a complete [tutorial](https://github.com/dportik/SuperCRUNCH/tree/master/docs/Trees-in-the-desert-workshop/SuperCRUNCH-Tutorial.txt) with all input data ([Phrynosomatidae-data.zip](https://github.com/dportik/SuperCRUNCH/tree/master/docs/Trees-in-the-desert-workshop/Phrynosomatidae-data.zip)) required to complete the analysis. A complete set of outputs from running the analysis is also provided ([Phrynosomatidae-Analysis.zip](https://github.com/dportik/SuperCRUNCH/tree/master/docs/Trees-in-the-desert-workshop/Phrynosomatidae-Analysis.zip)).
