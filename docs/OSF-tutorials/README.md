## OSF Tutorials

This folder contains the materials used to create the tutorials available on the Open Science Framework project page for SuperCRUNCH. The project page is located here: https://osf.io/bpt94/

This is meant to be an archive for these materials. However, you are free to use the tutorial files on this page. They are identical to the wikis on each of the analysis pages on OSF, and may actually render better here! However, you will need to retrieve the data files from OSF to begin a tutorial, so navigate to the analysis page you are intereste in first.
